The batter is a simple recipe which is made in a blender which is so much easier than having to mix everything until the perfect consistency. The ingredient list is very simple with a total of 9 ingredients with one being optional.

  <h2>Steps to Create the Scrumptious Crepes</h2>  
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Combine the ingredients.</strong>Start in a large bowl. Start by whisking together flour and eggs. Then add in milk, water, melted butter, and salt. Now stir to combine.</li>
      <li><strong>Blend.</strong> Start by pouring batter into your blender and blend for one minute until it is a smooth consistency.</li>
      <li><strong>Cook.</strong>Start by lightly greasing your non-stick skillet and heat over a medium heat. Scoop around 1/4 cup of your batter into the skillet and quickly tilt the skillet in a circular motion to spread the batter evenly on the skillet's surface. Cook your crepe for 2 minutes,or until it turns into a golden brown color.</li>
      <li><strong>Flip.</strong>Start by gently loosening the crepe with a spatula and flip it over. Then cook on the other side for 1-2 minutes until the crepe is golden brown on that side as well.</li>
      <li><strong>Repeat.</strong>Start by sliding the crepe out of the pan and onto a plate. Repeat the steps above with the rest of your batter.</li>
      <li><strong>Assemble and Serve.</strong>Start by spreading berries on half of the crepes and drizzle nutella on top of each crepe. Now fold the crepes into quarters and drizzle extra nutella on top. Sprinke icing sugar (powdered sugar) on the top if you want. Finally serve and enjoy your delicious crepes.</li>
