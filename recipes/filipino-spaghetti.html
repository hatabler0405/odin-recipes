  <h3>Filipino spaghetti sauce noodles, and hot dog bits in a pot ready to plate.</h3>
    <p>Sorry to all the traditional pasta lovers, but Filipino's adds sugar and banana ketchup to their spaghetti. This is what makes it so unique and delicious though, along with the hot dogs, cheese, and fish sauce. These ingredients may sound bizarre, but they sure piece together what seems to be a perfect blend of flavors. This dish was due to American colonization in the Philippines in the late 1800s. During World War II, General MacArthur ate a Japanese spaghetti neapolitan which uses ketchup as an ingredient. When he traveled to the Philippines, his staff changed the recipe to include banana ketchup and other ingredients which created the Filipino spaghetti.</p>
